## Scientific Functions
[rquirements]
* Ability to use triginomic functions <n>
* Ability to to use exponential functions <y>
* Ability to use square roots <y>
[additional-requriements]
* When sin/cos/tan is pressed, display sin/cos/tan to the display and then fill
* When asin/acos/atan is pressed, display sin/cos/tan to the display and then fill
[current-errors]
* When sin/cos/tan and asin/acos/atan is input and then cleared the following inputs are appended to the 0 that is replaced in the display
* x√y does not function: Invalid double error thrown
* % does not function: Invalid double error thrown
* % does not display when pressed
* 1/x does not function: Invalid double error thrown
* 1/x does not display when pressed
* ^2 does not function: Invalid double error thrown
* Combinding a function with other functions does not work: Invalid double error thrown


## Advanced Functions
[requirements]
* Ability to calculate 10, 15, and 20% tip
* Ability to use radians and degrees
* Ability to use constants such as pi, e, etc.
[additional-requriements]
* Ability to see negative sign before an input is presented/on 0
[current-erros]
* 3√ does not function: no error thrown
* log does not display when pressed
* cannot add two negative numbers
* cannot use funtions in tandem (ex: sqrt(1/2) + exp)

[additional-requriements]
* Ability to clearly see which function is being used <n>
* Expected user input/output associated
- When a button is pressed, there is a notification or chance to the display
